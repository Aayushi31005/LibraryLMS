**Description (Implementation Approach \& Key Learnings):**



This project implements a complete Library Management System using Java and object-oriented design. The system is structured into clear modules—Book, Student, LibraryDatabase, and LibrarySystem—ensuring separation between data models, business logic, and user interactions. Java Collections such as HashMap and HashSet were used to efficiently manage books, students, and issued records, enabling fast lookups and consistent state handling.



The implementation focuses on modular architecture, strong input validation, and data integrity across all core operations, including adding books, registering students, issuing and returning books, viewing records, and performing searches. Each component interacts cleanly, making the system easy to extend and debug.



In addition to the Java console version, a simple web-based interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) was created to visually demonstrate core library operations. This helped reinforce understanding of basic frontend logic and user-interface design.



Through this project, I gained practical experience in Java OOP principles, collection frameworks, program flow control, exception handling, and modular system design. The process strengthened my ability to build, test, and validate a fully functional application from start to finish.
