**Problem Statement**



The project aims to design and implement a Library Management System that simplifies and automates the process of managing books, students, and book-issue transactions. Traditional manual systems are time-consuming and error-prone, so an efficient, modular, and user-friendly software solution is required.



Scope of the Project



The system handles:



Book storage and availability



Student registration and tracking



Issuing and returning of books



Search functionality for books



Data integrity and validation across operations

The scope includes a Java-based console system and a simple web-based UI for demonstration.
